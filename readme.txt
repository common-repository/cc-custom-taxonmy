== Description ==

<p>CC - Custom Taxonomy is good for custom taxonomy and custom fields for taxonomy</p>
<p>There are two available taxonomies in WordPress, they are category and tag. We ourselves are able to add more taxonomies by using Custom Taxonomy function. However, sometimes, this function will be complicated and take much time. CC Custom Taxonomy plugin made by Chuyencode team supports developers to be easier to create as many taxonomies as they want.</p>
<strong>Core features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Add as many new taxonomies as you want.</li>
<li>Add new fields including text, text area, color picker, image, icon, switcher, Wysiwyg editor, gallery, background for each taxonomy as you want.</li>
</ul>
